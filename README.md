World GDP – Forecasting using Linear regression model:
(Prototype model)



Tools used: 
•	KNIME (Konstanz Information Miner ) - Data analytics, reporting and integration platform
•	Microsoft Excel




Database used: 
•	Oracle 12C   RDBMS 	
Project Summary:
•	A prototype model of the project was developed with an aim to forecast the GDP of countries for future days using the principle of linear regression. 
•	Developed a basic workflow of using Knime nodes and Oracle RDBMS.
•	Collected the GDP data of all countries using the HTTP retriever nodes from Knime platform and extracted the required data from the XML message using Xpath filtering.
•	Derived the insights from the available data by joining tables in database and visualize the existing results on a scatter plot and line plot.
•	Study the regression using the linear regression nodes and Polynomial regression nodes and Derived the future year GDP of the countries using the linear regression and polynomial regression nodes
